            I'm a man with passion for my family, programming, AI and rainy days.
            Here I want to share some info about me, my skills, interests and thoughts and contact infos.
            I hope you enjoyed this journey. I appreciate your visit!
          </p>

              I think that start with some short bio shoulde be appropriate. I'm from Slovakia, lovely little country at the heart of Europe.
              If you will be nearby I definitely recommend a visit. Most of my life I spend at Košice, the second largest city at our country.
              Here I studied from kindergarden to university. During mine times at elementary school I visited astronomy club. When I think about it
              now, it is strange because from these years I never look at starry sky with courious and amaze eyes.
              My highschool was focused on elecricity, but soon I find out that world of software
              is closer to my heart than world of hardware. After highschool I continued with education at Technical University of Košice. My focus was Cybernethics(fancy word for control engineering).
              Here I get introduction to AI and start experimenting. At first sight I fall in love with evolutionary algorithms, but neural networks during time captured my attention more and more.
          </p>

            During university years I join my path with Siemens Healthineers where right now I'm working as Machine learning engineer.
